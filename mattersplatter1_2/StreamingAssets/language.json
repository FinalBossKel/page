    "liquid_lesson1":"Liquid is one of the four states of matter. Follow the tutorial to see how we can use the behavior of water in its liquid form to get Chewy to the exit.",
    "liquid_lesson2":"Liquids take the shape of the container theyâ€™re in but maintain their volume! We can see in the game how the water changes shape as we guide it through the levels.",
    "liquid_lesson3":"If we zoom into the water really closely, we will be able to see its smallest parts. All matter is made of atoms and/or molecules (particles).",
    "liquid_lesson4":"A substance in liquid form is denser than a substance in gas form. The air bubbles are comprised of gases and get pushed up because they are less dense than the surrounding liquid water.",
    "solid_lesson1":"Water can also exist as solid in the form of ice! We will turn the water into ice to give Chewy a solid surface to cross to the exit.",
    "solid_lesson2":"Solid is one of the four states of matter. It has the ability to maintain its shape and volume so it fills the space, but unlike liquid, doesn't take the shape of its container.",
    "solid_lesson3":"When a substance changes from liquid or gas to solid, its atoms move closer together.",
    "solid_lesson4":"Most substances in solid form are denser than they are on liquid form. (The major exception is water.)",
    "solid_lesson4_a":"Magma (liquid) or molten rock is less dense than the surrounding rocks (solid) so it moves up.",
    "solid_lesson4_b":"The ice cube (solid) is less dense than the water (liquid) so it moves upward and floats.",
    "gas_lesson1":"Water can also exist in the form of gas! If you apply enough heat, water turns into steam. Let's turn the water into hot gas to fill Chewy's balloon.",
    "gas_lesson2":"Gas is one of the four states of matter. We can see in the game that gas changes both shape and volume, so it can expand and fill the available space.",
    "gas_lesson3":"When a substance changes from solid or liquid to gas, its atoms and molecules move farther apart.",
    "gas_lesson4":"State is an extrinsic property of matter that depends on conditions like temperature and pressure; it is not an intrinsic property that is the same for all samples of the substance. We can see that water is not by nature only solid, liquid or gas, but becomes any of these states when exposed to outside forces like heat or cold.",
    "plasma_lesson1":"Plasma is one of the four states of matter! Over 99% of the matter in the visible universe is believed to be plasma.",
    "plasma_lesson2":"Atoms and molecules that make up a liquid stay in contact with each other but move relative to one another. This is why liquids take the shape of their container but still maintain their volume!",
    "plasma_lesson3":"Atoms and molecules that make up a solid stay in contact with each other; they vibrate in place, but do not move relative to each other. This is why solids maintain their shape and volume.",
    "plasma_lesson4":"Atoms and molecules in a gas move quickly relative to each other; although they collide, they are on average far apart from each other. This is why gases flow and fill the space available.",
    "not_enough_stars1":"You don't have enough stars to skip this level. Play older levels to earn more stars!",
    "game_over":"You have reached the end of your adventure! See you on the next lesson!",
    "level_pack_unlocked":"Level pack unlocked!",
    "try_again":"Ran out of water! Let's try again.",
    "skip_1":"Do you want to skip this level? First skip is free but later it'll cost stars!",
    "skip_2":"You already finished this level. Skipping is free!",
    "skip":"Skip this level for 3 stars!",
    "skip_tut":"Looks like you're having a hard time. You can use stars to skip this level.",
    "simul_start":"Apply or remove heat to trigger state changes. Observe how the water molecules move.",
    "simul_end":"You can access this simulator anytime through the menu.",
    "level_pack_locked":"This level pack is still locked. Keep playing to unlock this level pack."
