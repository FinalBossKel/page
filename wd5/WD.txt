Lead a band of water damage prevention super specialists. Save an ill prepared house from the rainy season by making crucial decisions for your team. Repair water stained walls, clear blocked downspouts and gutters, waterproof doors and windows and more.

- Game begins with a briefing from a crew member. He explains the "punchlist", a list of tasks you need to perform to get a positive assessment from the inspector at the end of the game. The crew member will also explain how to move around the house by using the command center. You can go back to this crew member any time after the tutorials if you want to view your punchlist, fast forward to the next day, end the game by calling for a final evaluation or restart the game from the beginning.

-  The first area (kitchen) is a tutorial area. The crew will teach you how to perform tasks and the game introduces you to the concept of time in the game. You will perform two tasks in this area: clearing flood water and fixing a pipe system. To clear the flood, rapidly tap on the pulsating icon hovering over the flooded area. To fix the pipes, look for and click damaged areas colored red, the number you require is indicated at the top of the screen.

- After the first area, you will be able to move freely around the house. The game will no longer limit or guide you from this point on. It is up to you to decide how to spend your limited time for the day. You need to be aware of 1) how much time a task requires 2) how much time you have remaining for the day 3) what the weather forecast is (seen on command center) 

- Making mistakes will cost money. A perfect score is $0. Aim for a perfect score. There are 3 possible endings, but only 1 good ending ($0).

- At the beginning of each day, a crew member will review the state of the work site with you based on your actions from the previous day.
